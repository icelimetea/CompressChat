# CompressChat

Mod that passes your messages through the compression algorithm, so you could write a message longer than 256 symbols in length.
In order to view compressed messages, other players should have this mod installed too.

## Requirements

1) Java 19+ with preview features enabled (add --enable-preview JVM argument)
2) [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) library should be available on the library path (so JVM can find and load it)
